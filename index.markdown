I'm a PhD candidate in [political science](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/) where I'm a graduate student affiliate with the [Institution for Social and Policy Studies](https://isps.yale.edu/) and the [Center for the Study of American Politics](https://csap.yale.edu/). I'm also a research affiliate with the [Human Cooperation Lab](http://davidrand-cooperation.com/lab/) in the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.yale.edu/), and the [Justice Collaboratory](https://law.yale.edu/justice-collaboratory) at [Yale Law School](https://law.yale.edu/). 

My research focus is on political psychology and behavior (in America, as well as [other countries that are not America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3IaKVmkXuk)), and the design and analysis of (survey, lab, and field) experiments for causal inference in the social sciences. I draw on multiple methodologies in my research projects, but am especially interested in integrating qualitative and quantitative data using ethnography and experiments.

At Yale, I work primarily in collaborative research labs with [Greg Huber](https://huber.research.yale.edu/) and [Dave Rand](http://davidrand-cooperation.com/lab/). You can also find me in the [Yale StatLab](http://statlab.stat.yale.edu/) where I work as a statistical consultant to faculty and graduate students. Before graduate school I worked in public policy research as a Research Fellow in the [Melbourne Institute of Applied Economics and Social Research](http://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/) at the [University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/). I'm also an experienced data scientist and have collaborated with industry and government in Australia and the United States on a variety of applied research projects and consulting engagements. 

I have a MA in Statistics from the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](http://statistics.yale.edu/), an MPhil in Political Science, and an undergraduate degree in Accounting and Economics from the [Quinlan School of Business](https://www.luc.edu/quinlan/index.shtml) at Loyola University Chicago.
