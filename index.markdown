I'm a PhD candidate in [political science](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/) where I'm a graduate student affiliate with the [Institution for Social and Policy Studies](https://isps.yale.edu/) and the [Center for the Study of American Politics](https://csap.yale.edu/), as well as a research affiliate with the [Human Cooperation Lab](http://davidrand-cooperation.com/lab/) at [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/), and the [Justice Collaboratory](https://law.yale.edu/justice-collaboratory) at [Yale Law School](https://law.yale.edu/). You can also find me in the [Yale StatLab](http://statlab.stat.yale.edu/) where I work as a statistical consultant to faculty and graduate students. 

I study topics at the intersection of social psychology and politics, as well as the design and analysis of (survey, lab, and field) experiments for causal inference in the social sciences. My current research projects focus on the politics of intergroup conflict and cooperation, the psychology of prejudice and resentment, and how the behavior of government officials affects trust and legitimacy. Before graduate school I worked in public policy research as a Research Fellow in the [Melbourne Institute of Applied Economics and Social Research](http://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/) at the [University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/). 

I hold a MA in Statistics from the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](http://statistics.yale.edu/), an MPhil in Political Science, and an undergraduate degree in Accounting and Economics from the [Quinlan School of Business](https://www.luc.edu/quinlan/index.shtml) at Loyola University Chicago.
