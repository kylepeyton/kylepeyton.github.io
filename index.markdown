I'm a PhD candidate in [political science](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/) and a graduate student affiliate at the 
[Institution for Social and Policy Studies](https://isps.yale.edu/) and the 
[Center for the Study of American Politics](https://csap.yale.edu/).
I'm also a research affiliate with the [Human Cooperation Lab](http://davidrand-cooperation.com/lab/) in the Psychology Department, 
the [Justice Collaboratory](https://law.yale.edu/justice-collaboratory) at Yale Law School, and a statistical consultant at the [Yale StatLab](http://statlab.stat.yale.edu/).

My research focuses on political behavior and the design and analysis of experiments. 
For the 2017-2018 academic term I'm a [ISPS Graduate Policy Fellow](https://isps.yale.edu/team/directory/graduate-policy-fellow), 
studying how dissatisfaction with government affects support for redistribution in the United States.

I am an experienced statistical consultant and enjoy collaborating with industry and government on applied research projects. Before graduate school I emigrated to Melbourne, Australia where I worked in public policy as a Research 
Fellow in the [Melbourne Institute of Applied Economics and Social Research](http://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/) at the 
[University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/). 

I completed an M.A. in Statistics from the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](http://statistics.yale.edu/) at Yale University in 2017, and have an undergraduate degree in Accounting and Economics from the [Quinlan School of Business at Loyola University Chicago](https://www.luc.edu/quinlan/index.shtml).
