I'm a fifth year PhD candidate in [political science](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), where I'm a graduate student affiliate with the [Institution for Social and Policy Studies](https://isps.yale.edu/) and the [Center for the Study of American Politics](https://csap.yale.edu/), as well as a research affiliate with the [Human Cooperation Lab](http://davidrand-cooperation.com/lab/) at [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/), and the [Justice Collaboratory](https://law.yale.edu/justice-collaboratory) at [Yale Law School](https://law.yale.edu/). You can also find me in the [Yale StatLab](http://statlab.stat.yale.edu/) where I work as a statistical consultant to faculty and graduate students.

I specialize in the design, implementation, and analysis of randomized (survey, lab, and field) experiments with a focus on topics at the intersection of social psychology, public policy, and politics. Current topics include the politics of intergroup conflict and cooperation; the psychology of fairness, prejudice, and resentment; and how the behavior of government officials affects trust and legitimacy. Before graduate school I worked as a Research Fellow in the [Melbourne Institute of Applied Economics and Social Research](http://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/) at the [University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/).
