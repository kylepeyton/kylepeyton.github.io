I'm a PhD candidate in political science at Yale University and a graduate student affiliate at the 
[Institution for Social and Policy Studies](https://isps.yale.edu/)and the 
[Center for the Study of American Politics] (https://csap.yale.edu/).
I'm a research affiliate with the [Human Cooperation Lab](http://davidrand-cooperation.com/lab/) in the Psychology Department and 
the [Justice Collaboratory](https://law.yale.edu/justice-collaboratory) at Yale Law School. 
I also work as a statistical consultant at the [Yale StatLab](http://statlab.stat.yale.edu/).
My research focuses on political behavior and the design and analysis of experiments for social science research.

For the 2017-2018 academic term I'm a [ISPS Graduate Policy Fellow](https://isps.yale.edu/team/directory/graduate-policy-fellow), 
studying how the American public's dissatisfaction with government affects support for redistribution.

Before graduate school I emigrated to Melbourne, Australia where I worked on public policy research as a Research 
Fellow at the [Melbourne Institute of Applied Economics and Social Research](http://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/) at the 
University of Melbourne. I especially enjoy collaborating with industry and government on applied projects and am an 
experienced statistcal consultant. I completed an M.A. in Statistics from the Department of Statistics and Data Science at 
Yale University in 2017, and an undergraduate degree in Accounting and Economics from the Quinlan School of Business at 
Loyola University Chicago in 2009.
