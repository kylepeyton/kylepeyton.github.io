I'm a PhD candidate in [political science](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/) where I'm a graduate student affiliate with the [Institution for Social and Policy Studies](https://isps.yale.edu/) and the [Center for the Study of American Politics](https://csap.yale.edu/). I'm also a research affiliate with the [Human Cooperation Lab](http://davidrand-cooperation.com/lab/) in the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.yale.edu/), and the [Justice Collaboratory (https://law.yale.edu/justice-collaboratory) at [Yale Law School](https://law.yale.edu/). 

My research focus is on political psychology and behavior (in America, as well as [other countries that are not America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3IaKVmkXuk)), and the design and analysis of (survey, lab, and field) experiments for causal inference in the social sciences. I draw on multiple methodologies in my research projects, but am espeically interested in integrating qualitative and quantitative data using ethnography and experiments.

At Yale, I've worked primarily in collaborative research labs with [Greg Huber](https://huber.research.yale.edu/) and [Dave Rand](http://davidrand-cooperation.com/lab/). Before graduate school I worked in public policy research as a Research Fellow in the [Melbourne Institute of Applied Economics and Social Research](http://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/) at the [University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/). I'm also an experienced data scientist and have collaborated with industry and government in Australia and the United States on a variety of applied research projects and consulting engagements. 

I have a MA in Statistics from the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](http://statistics.yale.edu/), an MPhil in Political Science, and an undergraduate degree in Accounting and Economics from the [Quinlan School of Business](https://www.luc.edu/quinlan/index.shtml) at Loyola University Chicago. My academic CV is [here](https://kylepeyton.github.io/assets/Peyton_Kyle_CV.pdf).
