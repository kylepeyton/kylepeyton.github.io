I'm a fifth year PhD candidate in [political science](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/) where I'm a graduate student affiliate with the [Institution for Social and Policy Studies](https://isps.yale.edu/) and the [Center for the Study of American Politics](https://csap.yale.edu/), as well as a research affiliate with the [Human Cooperation Lab](http://davidrand-cooperation.com/lab/) at [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/), and the [Justice Collaboratory](https://law.yale.edu/justice-collaboratory) at [Yale Law School](https://law.yale.edu/). You can also find me in the [Yale StatLab](http://statlab.stat.yale.edu/) where I work as a statistical consultant to faculty and graduate students. 

Before graduate school I worked in public policy research as a Research Fellow in the [Melbourne Institute of Applied Economics and Social Research](http://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/) at the [University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/). I hold a MA in Statistics from the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](http://statistics.yale.edu/), an MPhil in Political Science, and an undergraduate degree in Accounting and Economics from the [Quinlan School of Business](https://www.luc.edu/quinlan/index.shtml) at Loyola University Chicago.
