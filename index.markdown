I'm a PhD candidate in [political science](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/) where I'm a graduate student affiliate with the 
[Institution for Social and Policy Studies](https://isps.yale.edu/) and the 
[Center for the Study of American Politics](https://csap.yale.edu/).
I'm also a research affiliate with the [Human Cooperation Lab](http://davidrand-cooperation.com/lab/) in the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.yale.edu/), and the [Justice Collaboratory](https://law.yale.edu/justice-collaboratory) at [Yale Law School](https://law.yale.edu/).

I study political behavior and the design and analysis of experiments. 
For the 2017-2018 academic term I'm a [ISPS Graduate Policy Fellow](https://isps.yale.edu/team/directory/graduate-policy-fellow), 
researching how dissatisfaction with government affects support for redistribution in the United States.

I am an experienced statistical consultant and enjoy collaborating with industry and government on a variety of applied research projects. At Yale, I work as a statistical consultant at the [StatLab](http://statlab.stat.yale.edu/). Before graduate school I worked in public policy as a Research Fellow in the [Melbourne Institute of Applied Economics and Social Research](http://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/) at the [University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/). 

I completed an M.A. in Statistics from the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](http://statistics.yale.edu/) at Yale University in 2017, and have an undergraduate degree in Accounting and Economics from the [Quinlan School of Business](https://www.luc.edu/quinlan/index.shtml) at Loyola University Chicago.
