## Note: June 15 survey is between-subjects survey experiment, July 13 survey
## is within subjects survey experiment plus additional Qs on policy attitudes
## & polce spending. Treatment variable is Z_protest_frame in June 15 survey &
## Z_defund_order in July 13 survey

## Questions re: protest support [Strongly oppose (1) … Strongly support (7)]: 
## Do you support or oppose protests to defund the police?
## Do you support or oppose protests by Black Lives Matter? 
## Do you support or oppose protests against police brutality? 

## Questions re: gov. spending (July 13 only). Excepting "police services", 
##  question wording & labels all from GSS. All presented in random order 
##  before "police services".  
##  Are we spending too much, too little, or about the right amount on ...
##  [Too little, About right, Too much, Don’t know]

## Questions re: the role of police and other social services (July 13 only). 
##   For the following list of activities, please say whether you think each 
##   should be performed by police only, by social services only, or by both 
##   police and social services. [Police only; Social services only; Both police 
##   and social services]. Activities presented in random order: 
##  - Responding to and investigating violent crimes (e.g. homicide, domestic 
##    violence)
##  - Responding to and investigating property crimes (e.g. burglaries, car 
##    thefts)
##  - Responding to and investigating vice crimes (e.g. prostitution, drug use)
##  - Conducting motor vehicle stops (e.g. traffic violations, sobriety 
##    checkpoints)
##  - Maintaining civil order (e.g. regulating the use of public spaces, 
##    dealing with loitering and panhandling)
##  - Crime prevention (e.g. patrolling high crime areas, monitoring 
##    surveillance cameras)
##  - Social services (e.g. assisting with dependent persons such as juvenile 
##    runaways and people with mental illnesses)
##  - Community engagement (e.g. meeting with residents about local issues, 
##    coordinating youth outreach programs)
