					Community Policing and Police Legitimacy: A Field Experiment

				<div class="collapsecontainer"><div class="collapse" id="Peyton2019COPS_abstract"><div class="well well-sm abstract">Repeated instances of high-profile police violence against unarmed civilians in the United States have drawn worldwide attention to the contemporary crisis of police legitimacy. Community-oriented policing, in which uniformed patrol officers engage in various forms of non-enforcement contact (e.g. foot patrols, community meetings) with the residents they police, has been widely promoted as a strategy for building trust in, and perceived legitimacy of, the police. To date, however, there is little convincing experimental evidence that community-oriented policing can effectively change attitudes towards the police. Therefore, in partnership with a large urban police department, we conducted a randomized field experiment to study the effect of positive police contact on citizens' attitudes via city-wide door-to-door community policing visits. These brief, non-enforcement interactions had a large positive effect on citizens' attitudes toward police, including legitimacy and willingness to cooperate. These effects, which remained large in a 21-day follow-up, were positive among all prespecified subgroups, but largest among black respondents and those less supportive of police at baseline.</div></div></div>

We examine the predictive power of both measures in explaining anti-black discrimination. In Study 1 we obtain a behavioral measure of racial discrimination using the Ultimatum Game (UG). We find that white responders engaged in costly discrimination against black proposers by rejecting offers they would otherwise accept from whites. Overt prejudice predicts which whites discriminate whereas symbolic racism does not. In Study 2, white third-party observers evaluate intergroup interactions in the UG, and overt prejudice predicts racially biased evaluations of the fairness of resource distributions made by black proposers to white responders, but symbolic racism does not. Finally, we re-analyze a published candidate choice experiment and find that overt prejudice predicts discrimination against a black candidate, relative to an otherwise equivalent white one. These results demonstrate the enduring importance of overt prejudice in American politics.</div></div></div>

				<div class="collapsecontainer"><div class="collapse" id="Peyton2018TrustGov_abstract"><div class="well well-sm abstract">Why isn't there more support for redistribution in the United States? Scholars have theorized that distrust of government is one potential mechanism. Across three independent survey experiments (N = 3,741), we find that large experimentally induced increases in political trust - enough to eliminate the partisan gap - do not generate more support for redistribution. Even under an optimistic prior, a Bayesian integration of the experimental results suggests the impact on redistribution is approximately zero. To rule out content valence as an explanation for the experimentally induced political trust, we compare these results with two additional survey experiments (N = 1,169) about corruption in the National Football League (NFL), and find treatment effects on political trust and support for redistribution that are indistinguishable from zero. Although the public's trust in government seems to update in response to relevant content, more trust in government does not necessarily imply more support for redistribution.</div></div></div>

A difference‐in‐difference analysis of participation rates in the National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy shows a substantial increase in participation rates the year after SEAM was implemented. However, administrators rarely carried out the threatened sanctions, and these initial gains largely dissipated in subsequent years. This unique episode illustrates the limited scope for promoting Indigenous school participation through conditional cash penalties.</div></div></div>

In light of previous studies questioning the utility of the pelvic examination, this trial addresses a critical question for patients with threatened abortion. We commend the authors for conducting the largest randomized trial on pelvic examinations to date, but several methodological issues raise questions about whether clinicians can make reliable inferences from this study.</div></div></div>
